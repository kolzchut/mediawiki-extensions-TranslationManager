- MAJOR: Re-work TranslationManagerStatus to work like Extension:Draft!
- Develop something like Extension:Drafts API-AJAX editing
- Add logging to changes in status lines
- [DONE] Rename to "Translation Manager" or something similar
- [DONE] Add a 'status' type ('untranslated', 'translated', 'in translation', 'in review', ...)
- [DONE] Show all articles on special page - union of page, tp_translation, ...
- [DONE] Add a line editor to change status/comments/suggested title
    - [DONE] If the article is not yet in tp_translation, add it there
- Create an initial importer?
- [Maybe] Add dependencies (transcludes) to table view (the main problem is that ext:LabeledSectionTransclusion doesn't add to the transclusion lists)
- [Maybe] Make dependency on extension:WRArticleType optional
